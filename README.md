Welcome to the ZX project, which I started with gitHub and myself. 

Why do I feel so sad, because from the beginning to now I feel that I have not succeeded, of course, the mood is the same now.

I decided to keep the project and record some of my feelings as a software engineer, which is the second meaning of keeping the project. 

The first one has already been said. It's a record of my and github's start time.

Good luck to all who see it.
